## What's Next

### 🚧 Section 3: In Progress

- Section 3 focuses on state, forms, and conditional rendering in React. Here's a summary of the concepts being explored:
- Props vs. State in React
- Using the useState hook
- Updating state (primitives, arrays, and objects)
- State change with callbacks
- Toggling state with ternary and &&
- React forms: input, textarea, radio, checkbox, select
- Handling form submissions
- Conditional rendering (&&, ternary operators)
- Passing state between components
- Shared vs. local state
- Dynamically applying styles
- Real-world app simulation with interactive challenges
- Fetching data from APIs and handling responses

## 🛠 Getting Started
