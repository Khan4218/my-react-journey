### ðŸ“Œ Project 1: Simple Static Page

A basic React static site built using Vite, showcasing:

- JSX structure  
- Component-based layout  
- Basic CSS styling

### ðŸš§ Section 3: In Progress

- Section 3 focuses on state, forms, and conditional rendering in React. Here's a summary of the concepts being explored:
- Props vs. State in React
- Using the useState hook
- Updating state (primitives, arrays, and objects)
- State change with callbacks
- Toggling state with ternary and &&
- React forms: input, textarea, radio, checkbox, select
- Handling form submissions
- Conditional rendering (&&, ternary operators)
- Passing state between components
- Shared vs. local state
- Dynamically applying styles
- Real-world app simulation with interactive challenges
- Fetching data from APIs and handling responses

- Combined state and effect practices
- Cleanup functions in useEffect
- Generating a random meme
- Sneak peek into Refs in React
- Practical use: scrollIntoView() with useRef
- Fixing iframe scroll bug
- Wrapping up with a Section 4 summary
- Stay tuned as I implement, break, fix, and learn from building an interactive meme generator powered by external APIs and React hooks!

## âœ… React Course Completed!

ðŸŽ‰ I've officially completed the entire React course!  
From static pages to full interactivity with forms, APIs, and hooks â€” this journey has been transformative.

## ðŸ”œ Whatâ€™s Next

I'm now planning to:

- Start building full-stack projects using React + external APIs
- Explore advanced patterns like context, reducers, and custom hooks
- Learn TypeScript for safer React development
- Dive into backend technologies (Node.js, Express, MongoDB)
- Deploy professional-level React apps
